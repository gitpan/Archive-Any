NAME
    Archive::Any - Single interface to deal with file archives.

VERSION
    version 0.0941

SYNOPSIS
        use Archive::Any;

        my $archive = Archive::Any->new( $archive_file );

        my @files = $archive->files;

        $archive->extract;

        my $type = $archive->type;

        $archive->is_impolite;
        $archive->is_naughty;

DESCRIPTION
    This module is a single interface for manipulating different archive
    formats. Tarballs, zip files, etc.

    new
            my $archive = Archive::Any->new( $archive_file );
            my $archive = Archive::Any->new( $archive_file, $type );

        $type is optional. It lets you force the file type in case
        Archive::Any can't figure it out.

    extract
            $archive->extract;
            $archive->extract( $directory );

        Extracts the files in the archive to the given $directory. If no
        $directory is given, it will go into the current working directory.

    files
            my @file = $archive->files;

        A list of files in the archive.

    mime_type
            my $mime_type = $archive->mime_type();

        Returns the mime type of the archive.

    is_impolite
            my $is_impolite = $archive->is_impolite;

        Checks to see if this archive is going to unpack into the current
        directory rather than create its own.

    is_naughty
            my $is_naughty = $archive->is_naughty;

        Checks to see if this archive is going to unpack outside the current
        directory.

DEPRECATED
    type
            my $type = $archive->type;

        Returns the type of archive. This method is provided for backwards
        compatibility in the Tar and Zip plugins and will be going away soon
        in favor of "mime_type".
