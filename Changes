    * Archive::Any->new($file, $type) wasn't working (thanks to Simon Wistow
      for catching this).

    * Removing unzip binary hack around Archive::Zip->extractMember bug.
    - Working around new extractTree() bug which can cause directories to
      be unzipped with permissions set to 0000.
    - Fixing is_impolite() and is_naughty() so they return true or false
      instead of the scalar result of a grep.
    - Failing gracefully should Archive::Tar/Zip->new() fail.
    * Fixing list_archive() and extract_archive() misuse so we work with 
      modern Archive::Tar.
    - Class::Virtually::Abstract now has a version # on CPAN.
    * is_naughty() would screw up if the first file in the archive wasn't
      a lone directory
